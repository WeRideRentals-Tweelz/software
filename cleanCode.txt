Quote Process 
	
	Creation quote -> dates, user informations
		1. Creer Quote avec checkin et checkout.
		-> Parse quote_id
		
		2. On login or register, TransformQuote -> use quote id and user_id to create new booking; 
		--> CHALLENGE : 
			-> use the login and register form by changing some informations
				-> the template needs to know either it is a login or register because of a quote. 
				-> to know that, if isset quote, then navigation needs to redirect to quoteController
				->otherwise, redirect to profile.

		3. Document Checker --> Service 
			ProfileController calls this service in order to know if the user already signed is document, or refused to signed it.
